# SCT_ML_1
# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict **house prices** based on features such as **square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, overall quality, and basement area**. It is part of **Task 1** of the **SkillCraft Technology Internship**.

The project demonstrates a complete **machine learning workflow**, from data preprocessing to evaluation and visualization.

## Features
- Data preprocessing:
  - Handling missing values
  - Scaling numeric features
  - Encoding categorical features
- Train-test split for validation
- Linear Regression model training
- Model evaluation using:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - RÂ² Score
  - Cross-validation
- Visualization of **actual vs predicted prices**
- Feature importance analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
